### About the Experiment 

As noted in the experiments on wear, there are many important parameters that govern the wear characteristics. These include applied load, time, coefficient of friction between sliding surfaces, wear material and sliding speed. This experiment focuses on the effect of sliding speed on wear properties with other parameters maintained at constant values.
